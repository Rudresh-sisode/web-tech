# Q
What is the use of rs.slaveOk()
# A
You would use rs.slaveOk() when your Mongodb is set up as a replicaset, 
and you wish to query one of the secondary nodes, rather than the primary.
slaveOk is instructing the shell that its ok to return results from a 
secondary (rather than a primary) even though the results may not be entirely 
consistent with the primary.
